    "There are four principles of object oriented programming.  Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.  Encapsulation includes the use of classes and methods.  When objects are incividually encapsulated you cannot make changes to the object directly, you can interact with it by calling it's methods. Abstraction refers to the idea that you don't really have to be able to see all of the things that are happening when you call the few publicly available methods.  It is like a car.  When you operate a car you turn the key.  You don't need to understand the individual parts that are being utilized to make the engine start.  Those are abstracted from the end user. Inheritance refers to the use of parent and child classes to create a situation where the initial parent class characteristics apply but new unique child characterisitics can be added which apply only to the child.  It is a way to reuse common logic and add only what is necessary at each level. Polymorphism refers to the ability of different child classes of a common parent class to utilize their own way of applying a common method within a single call to a list or similar.  \n",
